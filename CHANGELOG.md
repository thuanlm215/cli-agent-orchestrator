## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add the official xAI Grok Build CLI as the `grok_cli` provider, including
  isolated per-terminal MCP configuration, native hard tool restrictions,
  multi-turn TUI support, orchestration e2e coverage, and provider docs.

### Fixed

- tmux listing parse failures are retried once and reported as a distinct condition instead of surfacing as a bare `ValueError` that reads like "session not found" one layer up. libtmux 0.53.1+ zips `parse_output`'s fields with `strict=True`, so any short row (a pane or session vanishing mid-listing, or trailing fields tmux omits) raised `ValueError: zip() argument 2 is shorter than argument 1` — which propagated through `server.sessions`/`window.panes`, blocked launches outright, and left the pipe-liveness watchdog unable to tell a genuinely-gone session from a transient parse failure. Adds `TmuxLookupError` and routes the listing reads in `clients/tmux.py` through a single retry-and-classify wrapper; a failed `create_session` no longer leaves an orphaned tmux session that blocks relaunching the same name. Also caps `libtmux<0.53.1`, the last release that zips non-strict (caom-anv)

## [2.4.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- add Phase 0 Kiro engine selection (`v2` default; `kas` capability-probed and rejected before terminal allocation)
- Read-only profile HTTP routes for capability search, template discovery and schema retrieval, template-config validation, and rendered previews (#523)
- `CAO_HOME_DIR` environment variable to relocate CAO's entire data directory outside `~/.aws` (#467)
- **Self-learning loop** (opt-in, off by default; see `docs/self-learning.md`):
  - Phase 1 — outcome capture: `memory.learning_enabled` setting (`CAO_MEMORY_LEARNING_ENABLED`), `workflow_outcomes` table, `report_outcome`/`list_outcomes`/`store_lesson` MCP tools (the latter targets a named worker profile's agent scope so retrospective lessons reach the worker), scope-gated `POST/GET /outcomes` endpoints, and a built-in `retrospector` agent profile that distills session outcomes into worker-scoped memory lessons
  - Phase 2 — instruction promotion: `memory.instruction_promotion_enabled` setting (`CAO_MEMORY_INSTRUCTION_PROMOTION_ENABLED`; promotion ⊂ learning ⊂ memory), itemized-delta editing of a delimited `## Learned Patterns` block in profile files, `cao memory promote <agent>` CLI (dry-run by default, `--apply` to mutate), recall-count promotion gate, content-free audit logging
  - `cao-learning` shipped skill teaching supervisors/workers the outcome-reporting and lesson-storage habits
  - Validated by a 20-package controlled A/B experiment: +11 mean points on work items with headroom (6/6 wins, sign test p = 0.016), neutral at the ceiling — `docs/self-learning-validation.md`
- `cao profile find <query>` CLI verb and `find_profiles` MCP tool for keyword/BM25 profile discovery over metadata (name, description, tags, capabilities); metadata-only, never exposes prompt bodies (#340)
- Optional `capabilities` and `tags` arrays in the agent profile frontmatter schema (#340)
- **Durable workflow run journal** — a workflow run's execution history now survives a server restart and is inspectable after the fact (#504):
  - append-only `workflow_run_event` table with a per-run `seq` as the sole ordering authority; a swallowed append leaves a hole the read path DECLARES as a `GapMarker` (interior and trailing) rather than renumbering it away, so "nothing happened" is distinguishable from "an event was lost"
  - read routes over the durable journal, all answered with no in-memory `run_registry` dependency: `GET /workflows/runs/{id}` (enriched inspect), `GET .../events` (ordered timeline), `GET .../compare?against=` (per-step comparison), `GET .../diagnostics` (troubleshooting bundle). All four require a `cao:read`/`cao:write`/`cao:admin` scope when auth is enabled
  - SSE live-follow content-negotiated onto the same `.../events` path (`Accept: text/event-stream` or `?stream=true`): durable replay from a cursor, exact `Last-Event-ID` reconnect, and a terminal-state guard that closes an already-ended run instead of hanging the follower
  - `GET /terminals/{id}/output/range` for byte-exact reads of a terminal's append-only log
  - `DELETE /workflows/runs/{id}` (write/admin scope) removing a run and all its retained data, plus an age + run-count retention sweep at startup — `0` on either bound DISABLES that bound
  - web: a run list / detail surface with event-timeline playback (transport + ARIA scrubber), declared-gap markers, and a terminal pane synced to the selected event
  - output capture is OFF by default (metadata only); when enabled, retained text is size-capped and funnelled through the existing `audit_log` sanitizer. Four new `memory` settings — see [Configuration](docs/configuration.md#memory-memory)
- **Asynchronous workflow-run lifecycle** — runs are now submittable without holding a connection open for their whole duration (#505):
  - `POST /workflows/runs:submit` acks `202 {run_id, state, links}` the instant the run is durably journaled, then drives it in a background task. The blocking `POST /workflows/runs` is retained and byte-compatible. `GET /workflows/runs` lists journaled runs newest-first (`?state=`, `?limit=`), and `GET /workflows/runs/{run_id}/result` returns the full retained result for a detached, in-flight, or post-restart run
  - four CLI verbs: `cao workflow runs` (list recorded runs), `wait` (follow an already-submitted run), `result` (full detail), `events` (live SSE progress); `run` now submits-and-follows by default, with `--detach` to submit and exit and `--wait` for the retained blocking path
  - six MCP tools: `workflow_start`, `workflow_status`, `workflow_result`, `workflow_list`, `workflow_wait`, `workflow_events`. Note `workflow_list` lists **runs**, whereas the CLI's `list` lists **specs** — see the CLI ↔ MCP name mapping in `docs/workflows.md`
  - `GET /workflows/runs` and `GET /workflows/runs/{run_id}/result` require a read scope (`cao:read`, `cao:write`, or `cao:admin`) when auth is enabled

### Changed

- **BREAKING** — `cao workflow run --json` output shape (#505). It previously echoed the complete `WorkflowRunResult` (`run_id`, `workflow_name`, `state`, `steps[]`, timestamps, `kind`); because the default path now submits-and-follows rather than blocking, it emits only the stable terminal object `{"run_id": ..., "state": ...}`. A non-TTY plain `run` emits the same JSON. **Scripts reading `steps[]` or `workflow_name` off `run --json` must change** — use `cao workflow result <id> --json` for full detail, or `cao workflow status <id> --json` for a mid-run snapshot. `run --wait --json` is unaffected and still returns the complete `WorkflowRunResult`. Exit codes are unchanged across TTY, non-TTY, and `--json`
- **BREAKING** — the run-level `output` field is no longer returned by `GET /workflows/runs/{run_id}/result` or by the `workflow_result` / `workflow_wait` MCP tools (#505). Run-level output is not journaled, so the field was structurally always `null` on those journal-assembled surfaces; it is dropped rather than advertised. Per-step outputs are unaffected (`steps[].output`), and the blocking `run --wait` path still returns run-level output for script-tier runs

### Fixed

- workflow: the background drive's FAILED backstop no longer overwrites an already-settled run (#505). It fired unconditionally on any exception, so a drive that raised *after* the engine journaled COMPLETED/CANCELLED — during post-settlement bookkeeping — rewrote that terminal state to FAILED, making the durable record misreport the run's outcome. The write is now a conditional `UPDATE ... WHERE state = 'running'` in the journal DAL (atomic, so no concurrent settle can interleave), covering both the `Exception` and `CancelledError` arms; a run that raises *before* settling still lands FAILED as before, so no run is left orphaned in `running`
- workflow: `cao workflow events` closes its streamed SSE response on every exit path (#505). The follower breaks out of its loop on a terminal frame and abandons the generator on each reconnect, so without an explicit close the socket survived until garbage collection and a long follow with repeated reconnects accumulated live file descriptors. The equivalent MCP tool was already hardened
- workflow: a caller-supplied `run_id` that loses a concurrent-submit race now returns `409` instead of `500` (#505). The uniqueness pre-check and the durable insert are not one atomic operation, so both submits can pass the pre-check; the loser's `IntegrityError` is now mapped to the same `409` the serialized case reports

- profile store writes are now atomic and inter-process safe. Both store writes were previously bare `write_text` calls, so a concurrent `cao profile` write and a server-side write could interleave or leave a partial file. Adds `locked_atomic_write` to `utils/atomic_file.py` as the blind-write sibling of `locked_atomic_rewrite` (#492): it shares the same lock, temp file, fsync, mode preservation and `os.replace`, but skips the read, so a corrupt or non-UTF-8 file in the agent store can still be replaced by the install that would have repaired it instead of failing with `UnicodeDecodeError` (#543)
- self-healing pipe-pane liveness watchdog for silently-stalled FIFO forwarding (fixes #388) (#397), including detection of a stall that settles into a new static frame before the next poll and of a pipe that never delivers a single byte from terminal creation (cold start, harness-control#93) — see `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_COLD_START_GRACE_S` / `CAO_PIPE_LIVENESS_MAX_COLD_START_ATTEMPTS` in `docs/configuration.md`
- web: attach web terminals through the configured backend so herdr-backed terminals no longer fail to attach (#417)
- honor profile frontmatter `provider:` during install (flag > frontmatter > default) (#414)
- deliver messages with `tmux paste-buffer -p` on tmux >= 3.7, which sanitizes pasted buffers through vis(3) and rendered the previously hand-crafted `ESC [200~`/`ESC [201~` markers as literal `^[[200~` garbage in the receiving TUI; tmux < 3.7 keeps the hand-crafted wrap so TUIs that never enable DECSET 2004 (e.g. kiro-cli) still receive multi-line messages as a single input (#413)
- handoff workers now inherit the supervisor's working directory server-side in run_agent_step (#423)
